RadarScope Analysis
Overview
RadarScope provides comprehensive signal processing analysis for radar systems, focusing on window function optimization and performance evaluation. The toolkit addresses the fundamental challenge of selecting optimal window functions for pulse compression and range-doppler processing in radar applications.
Core Problem
Radar signal processing requires careful balance between range resolution, sidelobe suppression, and computational efficiency. Different window functions offer distinct tradeoffs in these parameters. This toolkit enables systematic evaluation and comparison of window function performance across multiple metrics to guide optimal selection for specific operational requirements.
Architecture
The system implements three core classes that work together to provide complete analysis capabilities:
RadarParameters Class
This dataclass defines the fundamental operating characteristics of the radar system. The parameters align with standard radar configurations while providing flexibility for different operational scenarios.
WindowFunctionBenchmark Class
The benchmarking engine implements thirteen different window functions optimized for radar signal processing:

Rectangular (baseline reference)
Hanning and Hamming (balanced performance)
Blackman and Blackman-Harris (interference rejection)
Kaiser with variable beta parameters (adaptive sidelobe control)
Taylor (precise sidelobe shaping)
Tukey, Flat-top, and Nuttall (specialized applications)

Each window function implementation includes computational benchmarking capabilities that measure execution time across different window sizes. This enables real-time performance assessment critical for embedded radar systems.
RadarSignalProcessor Class
The signal processor handles the core radar processing chain by applying windowing to matched filters, performing correlation via FFT, and returning compressed pulse responses. The processor generates synthetic radar returns with configurable target parameters, applies window functions during pulse compression, and performs range-doppler processing to create comprehensive performance maps.
Analysis Outputs
Figure 1: Window Function Time and Frequency Domain Analysis
Figure 1: Comprehensive Window Function Analysis for Radar Signal Processing
Time domain characteristics and frequency spectra for eight primary window functions, demonstrating the fundamental tradeoffs between main lobe width and sidelobe suppression
The time domain analysis reveals the characteristic tapering profiles that distinguish each window function, with rectangular maintaining uniform amplitude across all samples while advanced functions like Blackman-Harris apply sophisticated amplitude weighting to achieve sidelobe suppression. The frequency domain analysis demonstrates the direct relationship between time domain tapering and spectral characteristics, where rectangular windowing produces the narrowest main lobe at -13.0 dB peak sidelobe level, while Blackman-Harris achieves -92.0 dB sidelobe suppression at the cost of increased main lobe width.
The Kaiser window family demonstrates the parametric control available through beta adjustment, with β=3 providing moderate sidelobe control at -39.2 dB and β=7 achieving -63.4 dB suppression with correspondingly wider main lobes. This analysis establishes the fundamental performance boundaries that constrain window function selection, showing that enhanced sidelobe suppression always comes at the cost of reduced frequency resolution, requiring engineers to prioritize either interference rejection or target discrimination based on their specific operational requirements.
Figure 2: Quantitative Performance Metrics Comparison
Figure 2: Window Function Performance Metrics
Quantitative comparison of main lobe width, sidelobe suppression, processing gain, and equivalent noise bandwidth across thirteen window functions
The main lobe width analysis demonstrates the resolution penalty associated with advanced windowing, with rectangular achieving the narrowest 0.1 MHz width while Taylor windowing extends to 0.3 MHz, representing a 200% increase that directly impacts range resolution capability. The sidelobe suppression performance reveals the dramatic improvements available through sophisticated windowing, with Blackman-Harris achieving -93.1 dB compared to rectangular's -17.9 dB, providing 75 dB of additional interference rejection that enables operation in contested electromagnetic environments where simple windowing would fail completely.
Processing gain analysis quantifies the signal-to-noise ratio impact of windowing choices, showing rectangular windowing maintains maximum gain at 256 while Blackman-Harris reduces gain to 126, representing a 3.1 dB loss that must be considered in link budget calculations. The equivalent noise bandwidth comparison reveals how windowing affects noise performance, with advanced functions like Taylor showing 53 times higher ENBW than rectangular, indicating significantly increased noise sensitivity that may limit weak signal detection capability in noise-limited scenarios.
Figure 3: Pulse Compression Performance Analysis
Figure 3: Pulse Compression Performance with Different Windows
Range profile comparisons showing compressed pulse responses for six different window functions with 3dB and 13dB beamwidth references
The pulse compression analysis demonstrates practical performance differences in realistic radar scenarios, with rectangular windowing showing the narrowest compressed pulse width but exhibiting high sidelobe structure that extends across the entire range window at levels above -20 dB. Advanced window functions like Blackman and Taylor achieve dramatic sidelobe suppression below -30 dB, enabling detection of weak targets in the presence of strong reflectors that would otherwise be masked by rectangular windowing sidelobes.
The 3dB and 13dB reference lines illustrate the resolution tradeoffs quantitatively, showing that while rectangular windowing provides the finest range discrimination for isolated targets, advanced windowing enables target detection in complex scenarios where multiple targets with varying cross-sections must be resolved simultaneously. The Nuttall window demonstrates the extreme case of sidelobe suppression, achieving near-noise-floor sidelobe levels at the cost of significantly increased main lobe width, representing the optimal choice for scenarios where interference rejection takes priority over resolution performance.
Figure 4: Range-Doppler Processing Results
Figure 4: Range-Doppler Maps with Different Window Combinations
Two-dimensional range-doppler processing results using six different window function combinations, showing target detection performance across range and velocity dimensions
The range-doppler maps demonstrate how window function selection affects multi-target detection scenarios, with rectangular windowing providing the sharpest target responses but suffering from cross-range sidelobe contamination that can mask weak targets near strong ones. The red markers indicate true target positions at ranges of 5, 8, 12, and 15 km with velocities of 100, -50, 200, and 0 m/s respectively, enabling direct comparison of detection performance across different windowing strategies.
Advanced window combinations like Blackman-Blackman and Taylor-Taylor show superior target separation capability in complex scenarios, with significantly reduced sidelobe artifacts that enable reliable detection of all four targets despite their proximity in the range-doppler space. The mixed window approach (Blackman-Taylor) demonstrates optimized performance by applying different windowing strategies to range and doppler dimensions independently, achieving excellent target definition while maintaining computational efficiency through asymmetric window complexity allocation.
Figure 5: Ambiguity Function Visualization
Figure 5: Ambiguity Functions for Different Window Functions
Range-doppler ambiguity functions showing the fundamental resolution characteristics and uncertainty relationships for six different window functions
The ambiguity function analysis reveals the fundamental limitations and capabilities of each window function in the joint range-doppler domain, with rectangular windowing producing the characteristic thumbtack pattern that provides optimal resolution at zero delay and doppler but exhibits extensive ridge structure that can cause false target indications. The color-coded magnitude scale from 0 to -40 dB demonstrates how sidelobe energy is distributed across the delay-doppler space, with advanced window functions showing dramatically reduced sidelobe structures at the cost of increased main lobe extent.
The Kaiser and Flat-top window ambiguity functions demonstrate the parametric control available for optimizing the range-doppler uncertainty relationship, with Kaiser β=5 providing balanced performance while Flat-top windowing achieves near-ideal sidelobe suppression with corresponding main lobe broadening. This analysis enables engineers to select window functions based on the specific range-doppler resolution requirements of their applications, understanding that any improvement in sidelobe suppression necessarily increases the fundamental uncertainty in target parameter estimation.
Figure 6: Window Selection Decision Matrix
Figure 6: Window Function Selection Guide for Radar Applications
Normalized performance comparison matrix enabling systematic window function selection based on operational priorities
The selection guide matrix provides a quantitative framework for window function selection by normalizing all performance metrics to a 0-1 scale where higher values indicate superior performance for each criterion. Rectangular windowing achieves perfect scores (1.00) for resolution and processing gain while scoring zero for sidelobe suppression, clearly illustrating its role as the reference standard for resolution-critical applications. Blackman-Harris windowing demonstrates the opposite characteristics with maximum sidelobe suppression (1.00) but reduced resolution performance (0.16), making it optimal for interference-limited environments.
The matrix reveals optimal choices for specific operational scenarios: Kaiser β=3 provides balanced performance across all metrics with scores above 0.28 in all categories, making it suitable for general-purpose applications. Taylor windowing shows poor resolution (0.13) but maintains reasonable performance in other areas, positioning it as a specialized solution for applications requiring moderate sidelobe control with acceptable resolution degradation. This systematic comparison enables engineers to make informed tradeoff decisions based on quantitative performance data rather than qualitative assessments.
Figure 7: Doppler Resolution Capability Analysis
Figure 7: Doppler Resolution Performance Analysis
Doppler profile analysis showing resolution of closely spaced velocity targets separated by 25 m/s for four different window functions
The doppler resolution analysis demonstrates the impact of window function selection on velocity discrimination capability using two targets positioned at the same range but separated by only 25 m/s in velocity. Rectangular windowing provides the sharpest velocity resolution with clearly defined target peaks, but exhibits significant sidelobe structure that extends across the velocity spectrum at levels above 30 dB, potentially masking weak targets in the presence of strong ones. The target annotations clearly mark the true velocity positions at 0 m/s and 25 m/s, enabling direct assessment of separation capability.
Advanced window functions like Blackman and Taylor demonstrate superior sidelobe suppression in the velocity domain, reducing peak sidelobe levels below 20 dB while maintaining adequate target separation. However, this improved interference rejection comes at the cost of broader main lobes that reduce the ability to resolve very closely spaced targets. The analysis reveals that Hamming windowing provides an optimal compromise between resolution and sidelobe control, achieving reasonable target separation while maintaining sidelobe levels below 25 dB across most of the velocity spectrum.
Figure 8: Computational Performance Assessment
Figure 8: Computational Performance Analysis
Processing time analysis, memory footprint comparison, and system performance summary for radar signal processing implementation
The computational performance analysis reveals the processing overhead associated with different window functions, showing execution times ranging from sub-microsecond levels for rectangular windowing to over 100 microseconds for advanced functions like Taylor windowing across different window sizes. The logarithmic scaling demonstrates that computational complexity increases significantly with window sophistication, with Flat-top and Taylor functions requiring 10-100 times more processing time than simple rectangular windowing. This performance data is critical for real-time radar system design where processing latency must remain below strict timing constraints.
The pulse compression processing time comparison shows that all tested window functions complete processing within 107-112 milliseconds for realistic radar scenarios, indicating that computational overhead remains manageable for most applications. Memory footprint analysis reveals uniform 2KB storage requirements across all window functions for coefficient storage, demonstrating that memory constraints do not significantly influence window selection decisions. The system performance summary provides key radar parameters including 10 MHz sampling rate, 1.0 meter range resolution, and 150 km maximum unambiguous range, establishing the operational context for the performance analysis and enabling engineers to assess whether the computational requirements fit within their system constraints.
